# qmcu-appobject-approver

##What it does
The App Object Approver enables users to approve sheets, stories, bookmarks, and master library items in an app, thus, making them base sheets of the Qlik Sense application. In addition, it's possible to un-approve these app objects as well and push them back to the community.

##How it Works
To approve or un-approve objects, qualifying items will have a clear checkbox. Click the checkbox to activate and then select the appropriate approve or un-approve button that is relevant to the selections made.

App Object Approver facilitates multi-designer work flows in Qlik Sense applications by enabling user created app objects to become approved base app objects in an application through a simple interface.  Currently, there is no other way to make user created content base content in a Qlik Sense application.
